Treat this as a random walk. '(' is +1, while ')' is -1.

If drawing a chart of (distance from origin - y-axis) vs (SN # of char in the 
string - x-axis), it is a random walk of step 1. This question is asking to 
find the maximum span on the x-axis, within which all points are on or above
a certain level.
