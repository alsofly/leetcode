1. Palindrome Partitioning 2
Given a string s, partion s such that every substring of the partition is a palindrome.
Return the minimum cuts needed for a palindrome partitioning of s.
For example, given s = "aab",
return 1 since the parlindrome partitioning ["aa, b"] could be produced using 1 cut.

*2. Palindrome Partitioning
Given a string s, partition s sunch that every substring of the partition is a palindrome. 
Return all possible palindrome partitioning of s.
For example, given s = "aab",
Return
        [
          ["aa", "b"],
          ["a", "a", "b"]
        ]

3. Surronded Regions
Given a 2D board containing 'x' and 'o', capture all regions sorrounded by 'x'.
A region is captured by flipping all 'o's into 'x's in that surrounded region.
For example, 
    xxxx
    xoox
    xxox
    xoxx
After running your function, the board should be:
    xxxx
    xxxx
    xxxx
    xoxx
