This question is not a trivial one.... A good solution can be found here


1) Johan jeuring's blog: this is the original version of the solution. And
   gives some insights where this algorithm could be useful

2) Fred Akalin: this is more clearly explained and implemented in python,
   which is earier to read.

main.m.cpp can't handle all cases provided in leetcode
main2.m.cpp implented it with the algorithm provided in 2)
